            <b>What is acupuncture?</b>
            <p>Acupuncture is the ancient Chinese method of healing through the insertion of fine needles into specific anatomic points on the body called acupoints. By stimulating these points with needles, acupuncturists are able to trigger the body’s natural healing process.</p>
            <b>Does acupuncture hurt?</b>
            <p>Acupuncture is for the most part painless. The needles used for acupuncture are smaller than the standard hypodermic needle. You may feel a pricking sensation when the needles penetrate the skin. While some feel nothing at all, others experience a brief moment of discomfort while the acupuncturist is manipulating the needles.</p>
            <b>What should I expect during my first visit?</b>
            <p>It is best to arrive 10-15 minutes prior to your scheduled time so that you can fill out the necessary paper work. The first session lasts about two hours and consists of a consultation and acupuncture treatment. The session begins with a discussion of your medical history, current medications, present day complaints, as well as any questions or concerns you may want to discuss with the doctor. This is followed by a tongue and pulse examination. Once a diagnosis is made a personal treatment plan will be established and the actual acupuncture treatment will begin.</p>
            <b>What are the risks of acupuncture?</b>
            <p>In the hands of an expert, acupuncture has minimal risks for the patient. Here at the Natural Wellness Institute only sterile disposable needles are used so that there is no risk of infections. The needles are only used once, and then they are disposed of. Most importantly, all of our acupuncturists are professional and state certified licensed acupuncturists.</p>
            <p>Serious adverse effects of acupuncture are rare. Such minor risks may include bruising on or around the injection sites or dizziness after treatment is provided.</p>
            <b>How should I prepare for my first treatment session?</b>
            <p>Dressing comfortably with loose fitting clothes is best because sleeves and pants may need to be pulled up. It is also recommended that you do not receive acupuncture on an empty stomach since it may cause dizziness after treatment.</p>
            <p>Prepare a list of questions and/or concerns you may want to discuss with the acupuncturist. If you have any X-Rays or MRIs that you may want to share with the acupuncturist please feel free to bring them with you, if you think necessary.</p>
            <b>What is cupping?</b>
            <p>Cupping is an ancient Chinese therapy that is usually performed after the acupuncture treatment. It involves the application of heated cups on certain acupuncture points, usually on the back, to help improve circulation in the body. It is also beneficial for the treatment of menstrual and digestive problems.</p>
