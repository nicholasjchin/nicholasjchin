        <h1>About The Doctor</h1>
        <p>
          Dr. Wu is a New Jersey and New York State licensed acupuncturist. In 2004, she graduated from Pacific College of Oriental Medicine in New York City. Since her graduation, she has worked extensively in the fields of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. Dr. Wu has successfully dealt with many challenging cases and continues to do her best to help all of her patients. Prior to her current job as an acupuncturist and Chinese herbalist at the Natural Wellness Institute, Dr. Wu worked as a general physician from 1997 to 2001 in ShenZhen City, GuangDong Province, China. She practiced modern Western medicine at the Futian People's Hospital, also known as the No. 4 People’s Hospital in ShenZhen. Dr. Wu spent three years in the ER and two years in Internal Medicine. All of Dr. Wu’s patients regard her as experienced and knowledgeable, but above all as a good friend and a faithful advisor in the discussion of health and medicine. Apart from her active role in the medical field, Dr. Wu is also an excellent writer in the local newspapers, magazines and the internet. She won first place in the HanXin Chinese Literature competition in New Jersey in 2003. Her experience includes, but is not limited to, the publication of a few nutritional articles to help readers cook delicious Chinese foods. More recently in December 2018, Dr. Wu passed the World Federation of Acupuncture-Moxibustion Societies examination and is certified by reaching Doctor of Acupuncture (Level A) Standards.
