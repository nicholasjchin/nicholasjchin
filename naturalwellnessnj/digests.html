          <p>I came to Dr. Wu in early 2019. From my first visit with her, she took the time to go through my medical history, explained everything beyond belief, and assured me that she would do everything she could for my situation. 
          I had weekly sessions from that day in preparation for a hopeful pregnancy. With Dr. Wu’s guidance and wisdom I was finally able to conceive. Dr. Wu has been an absolute blessing, and anyone she treats is in for a positive result. 
          Her knowledge is stellar and you can tell that she loves what she does. Helping people with many different issues is her gift and she does it well. I’m sure I speak for all of her patients when I say, thank you Dr. Wu! 
          You are fantastic and a true blessing to all of us!</p>

          <p>I have been with Dr WU since 2016. Her caring ways and attentiveness enhanced my life in many ways. Her staff is exemplary and kind.  Faith at the desk is wonderful and a true human. 
          What a team! As a Registered Nurse I am sensitive to patient-relation, patient- satisfaction  and professionalism. I found all of the above in one office! After a vacation or a stressful day 
          at work my first impulse is to see Dr Wu and her team. Meeting her has been a transformative addition to my overall equilibrium. I wish you the very same. NM RN, BSN, Bc. CCM. 🌎</p>

          <p>I have been a patient of Dr. Wu's for approx 10 years.  Over the years she has treated me for several issues but currently I am treated for Ulcerative Colitis. 
          After the first treatment, I could tell a difference.   My G.I. physician believes acupuncture works well with these issues and we are working together to get me off the med's!    
          Dr Wu is a wonderful person and I also enjoy our conversations. She has taught me a lot about Chinese philosophy and medicine. Very positive person. I strongly recommend trying!</p>

          <p>I am enjoying my chicken soup with vegetables. Delicious! Suddenly, I realize that for three months, no, precisely 2 years, this is my first time enjoying a meal without worrying the consequence of serious acid flux and heart burning!</p>
          <p>I can not help myself writing the great experience with Dr. Wu, who has quickly brought my confidence back for a happy and healthy life. Combined with her magic acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine, she cured most of my health problems.</p>
          <p>It has been a fortune for me that we found her in internet, so I decide to share this in internet so that more patients, who are looking for a knowledgeable and kind doctor, can also be benefit from her treatment.</p>
          <p>I met her one month ago with a long list of symptoms. I was not able to eat very much due to the serious acid flux. I could not read my literatures as a researcher; I was not able to talk much as an educator! “Should I retire earlier” That was one of the serious questions started to occur in my mind. I never had this deep anxiety in my life before. I was so weak that I was not able to drive by myself to visit her doctoral office...</p>
          <p>She listened to me all the symptoms. Then she said firmly and confidently “You will be able to enjoy your meals soon, these symptoms will go away soon one by one, some of them may go away together”. I was not so sure I trusted all she said at that moment. Because for three months, I had been trying all kinds of treatments. Of course, none of them worked yet! But anyway, her words and her confidence brought hope to my mind. The following treatment was also amazing. I felt asleep during the acupuncture. It seems that with those little needles she injected energy to my body, and in the same time, drained off or magically blown away the “heavy clouds” in my head. After waking up, I felt my brain was crystal clear that I could solve the most difficult mathematic problems.</p>
          <p>It has been 36 days since my first visit, majority of those symptoms indeed disappeared, others are gradually leaving off me. I started to have a relative normal life. THANK YOU, Dr. Wu!</p>

          <h2>Antoineete P.</h2>
          <p>I started acupuncture like most people thinking how can this work, there are no pills, rubs, or medicine to take, how can this help? We have many questions, some we ask and some we just say in our heads. Like, am I going to become a human pincushion?
            When I drink water I am going to become a human sprinkler? Yes, these are funny silly questions and we know the answer, but there are serious questions, too. Is it going to hurt? When will I feel results? How does this work? Can you help me?
            We have all these questions and rightfully so, Doctor Wu takes the time to know her patients and she makes you fell at ease and worth listening to your complaint. You talk about where your pain is and even if you don't know where your pain
            is, she finds it. Amazing!</p>
          <p>So you start your session with a little smile, and an open mind still not sure what to expect. Secretly hoping that this has to help. You lay on the table and she says relax, before you know it your session has ended. Okay, you now have had
            your first session and think, "that wasn't so bad". When you take a drink of water, you don't spurt out water. LOL. The next day or so you realize you are feeling different, not sure how to put your finger on it, then it hits you, "acupuncture"
            could it be? Could this ancient Chinese medicine really be working? And the anser is <b>yes</b> it does.</p>
          <p>It is easier to explain if you are having pain in your neck and the acupuncture helps the pain go away. But, the wellness within is a little harder to explain; it is a feeling from within side of you, a lightness, and brightness, a peaceful
            feeling. You realize you feel GOOD, maybe for the first time in a very long time. You look forward to your next session.</p>
          <p>It's a feeling of balance, a natural high with out pharmaceuticals', with jsut a few thin needles. I think of it as an cherished silver vase that has tarnished over the years, still very beautiful but needs a little shine. This is what "wellness"
            from acupuncture does for you... You fell happy, bright, light, you feel positive, the tarnish is gone and you now SHINE.</p>
          <p>Wellness and balance you feel it... but everybody see's it, in your eyes, on your face, in your walk, in YOU.</p>
          <p>Thank you Dr. Wu.

          <p>I was diagnosed with dry eye syndrome. After a year of 2 different prescription eye drops, special soap, heated eye masks and otc eye drops, Dr Wu cured me after only 3 visits! Highly recommend! I wish I could give her 10 stars.

          <p>Dr. Wu,</p>
          <p>Thank you so much for helping me. I've been trying for so long, with Dr's to help my pain in my feet. I thought I'd never get relief, that pain was going to be a part of my life.
            <br>My aunt and uncle, introduced me to you, to see if acupunture can help after a couple of months. I was finally free of pain. My feet are wonderful. I can dance the night away.</p>
          <p>You, also helped my stomach problems and my husband's knee from arthritis pain.</p>
          <p>Thank you again
            <br>Richard and Angela B.</p>
          <p>P.S. "THE BEST STUFF EVER."</p>

          <p>I had chronic pelvic pain caused by benign cysts. My acupuncture treatments by Dr. Wu relieved my discomfort, and helped me to function normally and comfortably again. In addition, I was treated for menopausal symptoms and allergies, as well
            as aches and pains, with quick and excellent success. I am very greatful to Dr. Wu and her wonderful staff for improving my quality of life. I highly recommend her for whatever ails you!</p>

          <p>I don't know how to write this or what to say but here it goes...When I started to go to Dr. Wu I was weighing 197 lbs. I had struggled with my weight for the past 4 yrs due to my Thyroidism. Started gaining weight 4 yrs prior and was not able
            to lose any weight. I tried diet after diet, joined gyms with personal trainers... EVERYTHING. After only about 2 months with Dr. Wu I noticed a change. Today I weigh in at 166lbs and couldn't feel better. Dr. Wu has totally changed my life
            in more ways than she'll ever know. I'm happier and healthier. I'd recommend this treatment to anyone!!</p>
          <p>Thank you for changing my life,
